SYNOPSIS
    PScribo supports outputting GitHub Flavored Markdown format (.md) documents.

DESCRIPTION
    Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions for indicating formatting
    in email and usenet posts. PScribo implements the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) specification which is a
    strict superset of the CommonMark specification (https://github.github.com/gfm/).

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    There are some restrictions emposed by the GFM specification that means that some PScribo functionality cannot
    either be partially or fully implemented:

    - No indentation (-Tab) support as indented text is rendered as code blocks.
    - Text underlining is not supported/defined in the specification.
    - Image resizing is not supported/defined in the specification.
    - Only image links are included in the Markdown output, by default (see Plugin Options below).
      - Local image file references may not be rendered by some Markdown parsers/viewers (for security).
    - Numbered lists only support one level of indentation.
    - Headers and footers are not rendered in the output.

PLUGIN OPTIONS
    The Markdown plugin accepts the following output customisation options:

        TextWidth [int]               : Sets the default line length used for rendering output. If not specified,
                                        defaults to 120 characters per line. Note: table output is not wrapped.
        PageBreakSeparator [char]     : Specifies the character used for page breaks. If not specified, defaults
                                        to '*'.
        PageBreakSeparatorWidth [int] : Specifies the width of the rendered page break. If not specified, defaults
                                        to 20.
        LineBreakSeparator [char]     : Specifies the character used for line breaks. If not specified, defaults
                                        to '-'.
        LineBreakSeparatorWidth [int] : Specifies the width of the rendered page break. If not specified, defaults
                                        to 10.
        EmbedImage [bool]             : By default, web/file image links are included in the Markdown file. If enabled,
                                        all images will be Base64-encoded and appended to the end of the file.
        RenderBlankLine [bool]        : Markdown parsers typically ignore multiple/consecutive blanklines. When enabled,
                                        this option will output Html line breaks to ensure they are rendered by Markdown
                                        viewers.

    Output customisations are passed to the Export-Document cmdlet, e.g.

    PS> $document | Export-Document -Format Markdown -Options @{ EmbedImage = $true }
